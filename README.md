# Particle-Tracking

A program to study beam recapture process in presence of collective effects.

Recapture is a process when one RF system is replaced by another during beam acceleration. With collective effects, it can lead to unstable motion and beam loss.

To study the process, a particle tracking simulation is done for only longitudinal motion.
